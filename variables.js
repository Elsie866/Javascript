// Variables allow storing data in memory for use in a program/software
// In js we create/ initialize variables using var,const and let keybwords

// var -- old/legacy way of creating variables
var age = 90;

// let and const are modern/es6 ways of creating variables
let username = "Albert";
const interestRate = 20;

// let is used with vaalues/variables that change as the program runs
// const is used for values that do not change at any point in the life of a program/software e.g PI
const PI = 3.142;

//the value in variables can be access in the appllilcation using the variable names
// console.log(something) is a way for developers to print/see outcome on the terminial/console.
console.log(age);
console.log(PI + interestRate);
